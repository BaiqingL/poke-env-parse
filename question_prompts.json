{"0": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move spikes\n1. /choose move discharge\n2. /choose move recover\n3. /choose move scald\n4. /choose switch delibird\n5. /choose switch greattusk\n6. /choose switch darkrai\n7. /choose switch latias\n8. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose move spikes\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "1": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle.

Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move spikes\n1. /choose move discharge\n2. /choose move recover\n3. /choose move scald\n4. /choose switch delibird\n5. /choose switch greattusk\n6. /choose switch darkrai\n7. /choose switch latias\n8. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose switch delibird\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "3": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal.

Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move iceshard\n1. /choose move icespinner\n2. /choose move drillrun\n3. /choose switch pincurchin\n4. /choose switch greattusk\n5. /choose switch darkrai\n6. /choose switch latias\n7. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose switch greattusk\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "5": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type.

Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move closecombat\n1. /choose switch pincurchin\n2. /choose switch delibird\n3. /choose switch darkrai\n4. /choose switch latias\n5. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\nSince the Pokemon fainted, we cannot determine the exact move they used.

I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type.

Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\nturn 7\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Psychic p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 0 fnt\nfaint p2a: Great Tusk\n-end p2a: Great Tusk Protosynthesis [silent]\nswitch p2a: Darkrai Darkrai, L76 231/231\nturn 8\nswitch p1a: Passimian Passimian, L83, F 302/302\n-damage p1a: Passimian 265/302 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Darkrai Nasty Plot p2a: Darkrai\n-boost p2a: Darkrai spa 2\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move nastyplot\n1. /choose move hypnosis\n2. /choose move sludgebomb\n3. /choose move nastyplot terastallize\n4. /choose move hypnosis terastallize\n5. /choose move sludgebomb terastallize\n6. /choose switch pincurchin\n7. /choose switch delibird\n8. /choose switch latias\n9. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose move hypnosis\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "9": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type.

So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\nturn 7\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Psychic p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 0 fnt\nfaint p2a: Great Tusk\n-end p2a: Great Tusk Protosynthesis [silent]\nswitch p2a: Darkrai Darkrai, L76 231/231\nturn 8\nswitch p1a: Passimian Passimian, L83, F 302/302\n-damage p1a: Passimian 265/302 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Darkrai Nasty Plot p2a: Darkrai\n-boost p2a: Darkrai spa 2\nturn 9\n-terastallize p2a: Darkrai Poison\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 148/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Hypnosis p1a: Passimian [miss]\nturn 10\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 63/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Sludge Bomb p1a: Passimian\n-damage p1a: Passimian 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Passimian\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 40/231 [from] item: Life Orb\nswitch p1a: Cyclizar Cyclizar, L83, M 252/252\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move nastyplot\n1. /choose move hypnosis\n2. /choose move sludgebomb\n3. /choose switch pincurchin\n4. /choose switch delibird\n5. /choose switch latias\n6. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\nSince the Pokemon fainted, we cannot determine the exact move they used.

All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type.

In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\nturn 7\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Psychic p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 0 fnt\nfaint p2a: Great Tusk\n-end p2a: Great Tusk Protosynthesis [silent]\nswitch p2a: Darkrai Darkrai, L76 231/231\nturn 8\nswitch p1a: Passimian Passimian, L83, F 302/302\n-damage p1a: Passimian 265/302 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Darkrai Nasty Plot p2a: Darkrai\n-boost p2a: Darkrai spa 2\nturn 9\n-terastallize p2a: Darkrai Poison\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 148/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Hypnosis p1a: Passimian [miss]\nturn 10\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 63/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Sludge Bomb p1a: Passimian\n-damage p1a: Passimian 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Passimian\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 40/231 [from] item: Life Orb\nswitch p1a: Cyclizar Cyclizar, L83, M 252/252\nturn 11\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Rapid Spin p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 0 fnt\n-boost p1a: Cyclizar spe 1\n-sideend p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes [from] move: Rapid Spin [of] p1a: Cyclizar\nfaint p2a: Darkrai\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nturn 12\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Shed Tail p1a: Cyclizar\n-start p1a: Cyclizar Substitute [from] move: Shed Tail\n-damage p1a: Cyclizar 126/252\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 205/263 [from] Shed Tail\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Spinner p1a: Electivire\n-end p1a: Electivire Substitute\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move iceshard\n1. /choose move icespinner\n2. /choose move drillrun\n3. /choose switch pincurchin\n4. /choose switch latias\n5. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose switch latias\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "13": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up.

However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\nturn 7\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Psychic p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 0 fnt\nfaint p2a: Great Tusk\n-end p2a: Great Tusk Protosynthesis [silent]\nswitch p2a: Darkrai Darkrai, L76 231/231\nturn 8\nswitch p1a: Passimian Passimian, L83, F 302/302\n-damage p1a: Passimian 265/302 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Darkrai Nasty Plot p2a: Darkrai\n-boost p2a: Darkrai spa 2\nturn 9\n-terastallize p2a: Darkrai Poison\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 148/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Hypnosis p1a: Passimian [miss]\nturn 10\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 63/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Sludge Bomb p1a: Passimian\n-damage p1a: Passimian 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Passimian\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 40/231 [from] item: Life Orb\nswitch p1a: Cyclizar Cyclizar, L83, M 252/252\nturn 11\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Rapid Spin p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 0 fnt\n-boost p1a: Cyclizar spe 1\n-sideend p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes [from] move: Rapid Spin [of] p1a: Cyclizar\nfaint p2a: Darkrai\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nturn 12\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Shed Tail p1a: Cyclizar\n-start p1a: Cyclizar Substitute [from] move: Shed Tail\n-damage p1a: Cyclizar 126/252\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 205/263 [from] Shed Tail\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Spinner p1a: Electivire\n-end p1a: Electivire Substitute\nturn 13\nswitch p2a: Latias Latias, L79, F 256/256\nmove p1a: Electivire Supercell Slam p2a: Latias\n-damage p2a: Latias 174/256\n-damage p1a: Electivire 179/263 [from] item: Life Orb\nturn 14\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 178/272\nmove p2a: Latias Draco Meteor p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 57/272\n-unboost p2a: Latias spa 2\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move dracometeor\n1. /choose switch pincurchin\n2. /choose switch delibird\n3. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose move dracometeor\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "15": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible.

This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\ngen 9\ntier [Gen 9] Random Battle\nrule Species Clause: Limit one of each Pok\u00e9mon\nrule HP Percentage Mod: HP is shown in percentages\nrule Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep\nrule Illusion Level Mod: Illusion disguises the Pok\u00e9mon's true level\nstart\nswitch p1a: Dragonite Dragonite, L74, F 257/257\nswitch p2a: Pincurchin Pincurchin, L99, M 255/255\n-fieldstart move: Electric Terrain [from] ability: Electric Surge [of] p2a: Pincurchin\nturn 1\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Pincurchin\n-damage p2a: Pincurchin 147/255\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Spikes p1a: Dragonite\n-sidestart p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 162/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 2\nmove p1a: Dragonite Dragon Dance p1a: Dragonite\n-boost p1a: Dragonite atk 1\n-boost p1a: Dragonite spe 1\nmove p2a: Pincurchin Discharge p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 185/257\n-heal p2a: Pincurchin 177/255 [from] item: Leftovers\nturn 3\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nmove p1a: Dragonite Earthquake p2a: Delibird\n-immune p2a: Delibird\nturn 4\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Shard p1a: Dragonite\n-damage p1a: Dragonite 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Dragonite\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 263/263\n-damage p1a: Electivire 231/263 [from] Spikes\nturn 5\nswitch p2a: Great Tusk Great Tusk, L77 304/304\nmove p1a: Electivire Knock Off p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 264/304\n-enditem p2a: Great Tusk Leftovers [from] move: Knock Off [of] p1a: Electivire\n-damage p1a: Electivire 205/263 [from] item: Life Orb\n-fieldend move: Electric Terrain\nturn 6\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 272/272\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 238/272 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Great Tusk Close Combat p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 178/272\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk def 1\n-unboost p2a: Great Tusk spd 1\nturn 7\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Psychic p2a: Great Tusk\n-damage p2a: Great Tusk 0 fnt\nfaint p2a: Great Tusk\n-end p2a: Great Tusk Protosynthesis [silent]\nswitch p2a: Darkrai Darkrai, L76 231/231\nturn 8\nswitch p1a: Passimian Passimian, L83, F 302/302\n-damage p1a: Passimian 265/302 [from] Spikes\nmove p2a: Darkrai Nasty Plot p2a: Darkrai\n-boost p2a: Darkrai spa 2\nturn 9\n-terastallize p2a: Darkrai Poison\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 148/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Hypnosis p1a: Passimian [miss]\nturn 10\nmove p1a: Passimian Close Combat p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 63/231\n-unboost p1a: Passimian def 1\n-unboost p1a: Passimian spd 1\nmove p2a: Darkrai Sludge Bomb p1a: Passimian\n-damage p1a: Passimian 0 fnt\nfaint p1a: Passimian\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 40/231 [from] item: Life Orb\nswitch p1a: Cyclizar Cyclizar, L83, M 252/252\nturn 11\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Rapid Spin p2a: Darkrai\n-damage p2a: Darkrai 0 fnt\n-boost p1a: Cyclizar spe 1\n-sideend p1: MichaelderBeste2 Spikes [from] move: Rapid Spin [of] p1a: Cyclizar\nfaint p2a: Darkrai\nswitch p2a: Delibird Delibird, F 252/252\nturn 12\nmove p1a: Cyclizar Shed Tail p1a: Cyclizar\n-start p1a: Cyclizar Substitute [from] move: Shed Tail\n-damage p1a: Cyclizar 126/252\nswitch p1a: Electivire Electivire, L84, M 205/263 [from] Shed Tail\nmove p2a: Delibird Ice Spinner p1a: Electivire\n-end p1a: Electivire Substitute\nturn 13\nswitch p2a: Latias Latias, L79, F 256/256\nmove p1a: Electivire Supercell Slam p2a: Latias\n-damage p2a: Latias 174/256\n-damage p1a: Electivire 179/263 [from] item: Life Orb\nturn 14\nswitch p1a: Gothitelle Gothitelle, L90, F 178/272\nmove p2a: Latias Draco Meteor p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 57/272\n-unboost p2a: Latias spa 2\nturn 15\nmove p1a: Gothitelle Dark Pulse p2a: Latias\n-damage p2a: Latias 74/256\nmove p2a: Latias Draco Meteor p1a: Gothitelle\n-damage p1a: Gothitelle 0 fnt\n-unboost p2a: Latias spa 2\nfaint p1a: Gothitelle\nswitch p1a: Cyclizar Cyclizar, L83, M 210/252\n\nThe winner had the following choices:\n0. /choose move dracometeor\n1. /choose switch pincurchin\n2. /choose switch delibird\n3. /choose switch oinkolognef\n\n\nThe winner chose to do the following:\n/choose switch oinkolognef\n\nFormat your response in the following way:\n\n<Summary>\n<Step 1>\n<Step 2>\n<Step 3>\n<Step n...>\n<Conclusion>\n\nRespond as if you don't know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "16": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

conclusion\n    ", "18": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn.

It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb.

This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity.

For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown.

I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "24": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out.

This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help.

to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "25": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown.

It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage.

In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard.

So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

know what move the player chose, and you managed to analyze the situation to arrive at the conclusion\n    ", "30": "Imagine you're an expert Pokemon Showdown player analyzing a random battle. I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

I'll provide you with a scenario from a Gen 9 random battle, including details about both teams, the current field conditions, and the move that was just made. I want you to explain why the player likely chose that specific move.\nIn your response, please:\n\nStart with a brief overview of the situation.\nBreak down your reasoning step-by-step, consider the following tips for analyzing the situation:\nIt's really important to know things like what different items do, what different abilities Pokemon have, the moves that are in the game and what those moves do, their accuracies and power and their effects, and knowing as best you can the Pokemon type weaknesses chart. All this stuff you can look up either in Google or in the Pokemon interface, but remember that in a Showdown battle you are on the clock. If you spend too much time looking up things, you're not going to have enough time to be present strategizing in combat. So the more stuff you can memorize ahead of time, the more helpful it's going to be for your actual battles.\nRandom Battles is unique in that it purely measures battling skill as players have no control over their teams. In other tiers, the viability of teams will affect players' win-loss records, but in Random Battles, everyone is on an even playing field. Many argue against the competitiveness of Random Battles by pointing out how the random factor can either bring a good or bad matchup, making player skill level hard to determine. This is a good point, but it only holds true for each individual battle. Given the law of large numbers, in the long run everyone will get similar amounts of good and bad matchups and everyone will get haxed the same amount. So eventually, players will be placed on the ladder accordingly with their skill level. The ladder itself proves this, because for example the top 30 has the same names floating around, which shows rankings aren't entirely decided by luck of the draw.\nRandom Battles is also easy to play on the go which makes it a convenient pastime. If players are on a device that does not have their teams in it and they are looking for some quick battles, Random Battles is there to quench that thirst. It is also not an official tier like VGC or Smogon's OU, so it's easy to not get too invested in it, resulting in less frustration.\nThe gameplay of Random Battles is notably different from usual tiers due to the following changes:\nEvery Pokemon has a neutral nature and has 504 EVs spread evenly across the board, making for 84 EVs in each stat. There is one exception for Pokemon that carry Trick Room which is that their Speed gets 0 EVs, but their other stats still have 84 EVs each. All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's

All Pokemon get perfect 31 IVs across the board, and Trick Room Pokemon are not exempt from this.\nMovesets are randomised so Pokemon don't always get the best sets. They aren't entirely random, but rather are any combo of four from moves each Pokemon runs. So, it is possible to get a Nasty Plot Infernape with 3 physical attacks, or perhaps a Chansey with no Softboiled or Wish.\nUnlike other tiers, teams aren't entirely visible from the get go. Instead, Pokemon are only revealed as they are sent out. This opens up quite a few battling strategies which are discussed below.\nA win condition is best defined as something that can take down multiple Pokemon, usually ending up winning the game. These are usually Pokemon with set up moves because through boosting their stats to supernatural levels, they can blow through the opponent's team. On the other hand, they could be very bulky Pokemon that the opponent cannot take down. These Pokemon can gradually win the game by chipping away with weak attacks or using moves like Toxic, while recovering health whenever necessary.\nThe above definitions only fit for general cases however, because technically any Pokemon can be a win condition. For example, you have a Rhyperior, Virizion, and Leavanny remaining while your opponent has a Talonflame and a Mega Glalie. In this case, Rhyperior is the win condition because without it, Talonflame will just destroy Virizion and Leavanny, giving your opponent an easy win.\nSo, in a situation where Rhyperior is out against Mega Glalie, it is better to sack the Leavanny as it beats neither Mega Glalie or Talonflame. It is never acceptable to sack Rhyperior just because Virizion and Leavanny can't switch into Mega Glalie. After sacking Leavanny, Virizion can be sent out to Close Combat and finish off the Mega Glalie, or perhaps Stone Edge the incoming Talonflame if prediction is necessary or desired.\nThere are two main tips for playing around the lack of team preview. Further ones are discussed in the advanced tips section. Both main tips relate to win conditions, but in practice can be applied to any Pokemon that seems like it can cause a lot of trouble to the opponent.\nThe first tip is to hide win conditions unless it is absolutely necessary to send them out. The benefit of hiding win conditions is that your opponent may end up sacking their check or counter to it. To demonstrate, you have a Geomancy Xerneas which is walled by the opponent's Chansey. If your opponent has yet to see your Xerneas, they may end up sacking the Chansey because they feel they can afford to, or a situation in the battle has pressured it. However, if Xerneas was revealed, your opponent will be a lot more conservative with the Chansey, ensuring it is healthy enough to check Xerneas. This method exploits team preview by revealing as little of your team as possible.\nThe second tip is a counterpart to the first, which is trying to expose as much of the opponent's team as possible. This is normally achieved as the battle is played out, but using phasing moves such as Dragon Tail and Whirlwind can help. Laying up hazards can also help as Toxic Spikes forces the opponent to send out a Poison type, while other hazards such as Stealth Rock force out their hazard clearer. The advantage of this tip is that by exposing your opponent's team, you may identify further win conditions, and / or when your primary win condition can be sent out.\nWin conditions have been discussed a lot so it may seem battle plans should be entirely focussed around them as soon as they are identified, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Often, as the battle plays out, the primary win condition may no longer be needed because another one has been discovered. Going off the previous example, Chansey may be preventing that Xerneas from sweeping, but now Hitmonchan finishes off the opponent's Chansey, Cacturne, and Tyranitar. In this case, it is fine to sack or play aggressively with the Xerneas should a situation demand it.\nDue to the endless permutations, it is not possible to give advice that covers what the best play is for every single turn. Nonetheless, a point to take from the previous paragraph is that players should be mindful of all the situational changes that occur in every turn. Identifying and playing to win conditions works as a general strategy, but individual initiative is needed to determine when the plan can be changed or dismissed.\nHazards are paramount in any tier, but their importance is even greater in Random Battles due to the heavily switching focused nature of the format, and the good chance that the opponent has no hazard removal. It is advised to make it a priority to get them up as soon as possible, but not to set them up at every single opportunity. Sometimes recovering health or dishing out damage will be more important, and only basic battling experience is needed to determine this.\nStatus moves are fantastic in Random Battles because they are very spammable, which is highly appreciated in a format where the opponent's team isn't shown. When to use them should be obvious enough, but for the sake of a little in-depth advice, they're good to use when it's obvious the opponent will switch out. For instance, Hippowdon is out against a Magcargo. It's near certain that the Magcargo will switch out in fear of Earthquake, so it's better to use Toxic with the Hippowdon to punish the incoming check by putting it on a timer.\nAdvanced tips are best described as something players can do when they are very focused and not just playing on auto-pilot. If they are correctly applied, players can gain very discrete advantages.\nA double down occurs when both Pokemon on the field faint in the same turn. For example, Garchomp takes down Heatran with Earthquake but also faints to recoil from its Life Orb. Not knowing the opponent's Pokemon may tempt players to randomly select which Pokemon to send out, but there are advantages to be gained with smart selecting. This can be achieved by sending out a Pokemon that has its weaknesses covered. To demonstrate, you have a Landorus-T and a Xurkitree. If Landorus-T is sent out, it can be threatened and forced out by Ice and Water type Pokemon. Xurkitree resists neither of these types, so it will have to take considerable damage upon switching in. However, if Xurkitree was sent out and a Ground type Pokemon threatens and forces it out, Landorus-T gets a free switch in thanks to its immunity. In this case, neither Pokemon will have to take damage. Following this rule will result in far more favourable situations in a scenario that most players think is down to luck.\nOf course, there will be situations where no Pokemon has its weaknesses covered. In such situations, it is best to send out a Pokemon that has already been revealed to the opponent as this gains the advantage of hiding your team. The benefits of this are already stated in the basic tips section. In the rarer case of all revealed Pokemon being fainted and no Pokemon having its weaknesses covered, it's best to follow the rules of hiding win conditions / stronger Pokemon and sending out the most disposable Pokemon. However, there is a danger of the weaker / more disposable Pokemon being set up bait to an incoming sweeper, so Pokemon that carry Taunt, status or phasing moves are favoured. It is not possible to know which Pokemon your opponent will send out however, so there is still an element of luck involved.\nThese strategies are the more advanced ways to play around no team preview that were mentioned in the basic tips section.\nSome very crucial information can be gathered about the opponent's movesets if the moves they use are noted each turn. For instance, your boosted Dragon Dance Salamence is about to sweep but your opponent sends out Mamoswine, forcing a switch out in fear of Ice Shard. Upon switching out, if the opponent does not use Ice Shard, and instead goes for Icicle Crash, it's very likely that the Mamoswine does not have Ice Shard. Thus, the next time Salamence boosts with Dragon Dance and Mamoswine is sent out, you should be free to finish it off rather than switching out. This is just one example upon many, so using this tactic can open up many other ways to win that would otherwise be unconsidered.\nObserving how the opponent switches can also yield significant information, particularly with deciding which Pokemon is a threat to their team. As an example, Choice Specs Heliolisk is out against the opponent's Golduck. Instead of switching in a Pokemon that resists Electric, the opponent sacks Golduck to Thunderbolt. This indicates that the opponent either has no Electric resists or no checks to Heliolisk, so it can be ascertained that Heliolisk is a massive threat and thus a win condition. Furthermore, if you have another Electric type like Raikou, then it can be determined that it also is a threat as it is quite similar to Heliolisk. In this situation, Heliolisk and Raikou should pretty much guarantee a win because as one punches holes in the opponent's team, the other should have no problem cleaning up. So, in a nutshell, if the opponent doesn't switch in a Pokemon that has a type advantage against the one you currently have in play, you can determine that that Pokemon is a threat, or that the type of that Pokemon threatens your opponent's team.\nGeneration 9 introduces Terastallization, which lets your Pokemon transform in the middle of battle from its current typing into its Tera type. This adds a new layer of depth to Gen 9 battles. Tera typing can be super useful for things such as setting up STAB moves for that Tera type, setting up your Terablast users, or resisting a predicted attack you know your opponent is going to use.\n\nConsider alternative moves the player could have made and why they might have been rejected.\nConclude with a summary of why this move was likely the best choice in this situation.\n\nHere's
